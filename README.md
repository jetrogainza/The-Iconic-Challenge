# The-Iconic-Challenge
## Assignment handed by "The Iconic"
To see the code written for every question, just open and run each Jupyter Notebook.
Here are also some csv files I have saved as checkpoints during the data cleaning. The Deep Learning model is also saved in this same folder

Every detail of how -and why- I did the things is well-documented on each Notebook.

If you want me to better erase this Repo (because of confindentiality about the challenge) please tell me, and I send you everything on Google Drive
